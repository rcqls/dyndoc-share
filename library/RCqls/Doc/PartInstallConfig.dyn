## Dyndoc Config

* open terminal (ConEmu for Windows user) and type: `dyn-init`
* edit `~/dyndoc/etc/dyndoc_library_path` (maybe later is better since you don't have any personal library yet): this a semicolon separated list of paths supposed to contain dyndoc library.
* dyndoc test: open a terminal and go to dyndoc folder (`HOME/dyndoc`)
```{bash}
cd demo
dyn first
pdflatex first
```
Normally, if everything is fine, `first.tex` and `first.pdf` are created.
